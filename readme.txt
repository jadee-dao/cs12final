Holiday figure Santa Claus is said to have two lists: the “naughty list” and the “nice list”. 
He checks over his list twice. If you are nice you get presents. If you are naughty you get a 
lump of coal in your stocking. However, how does someone know what list they are on? Using 
OpenCV, a Python-based library for real-time computer vision, and Dlib, a C++-based toolkit for 
machine learning, this project implements face detection and tracking in real time, identifying 
whether or not the person on the webcam video feed is on the “naughty list” or the “nice list”.

This project is for entertainment purposes only. The given label “naughty” or “nice” per face 
detected is randomly assigned, and should not be used for real assessment.
